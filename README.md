Attempting to create an affordable DIY beer can seamer using 3D printed parts and a cheap drillpress.

## Project status / worklog

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS, I HAVE NOT YET SUCCESSFULLY SEAMED ANY CANS.

19.09.2016: Created project on github to store files and instructions. I'll be printing the last parts this afternoon, and hopefully receive sample cans tomorrow and perform the first test.


## Hardware store shopping list:

1m M12 threaded rod, cut into 2x350mm and 2x 150mm

20-30 M12 nuts, and/or 5-10 M12 lock nuts

Assembly for chuck (I used this one: http://www.biltema.no/no/Verktoy/Slipe-og-kappe/Ovrig/Holder-for-grovrengjorer-2000017844/)

1x 25x52x15 Bearing for "spinner" (turntable) (http://www.biltema.no/no/Bil---MC/Laste-og-Trekke/Tilhenger/Reservedeler/Kulelager-2000019337/?artId=41401)

4x 12x28x8 Bearings for levers (http://www.biltema.no/no/Bil---MC/Laste-og-Trekke/Tilhenger/Reservedeler/Kulelager-2000019337/?artId=41413)

4x 8x22x7 Bearings for rolls (http://www.biltema.no/no/Bil---MC/Laste-og-Trekke/Tilhenger/Reservedeler/Kulelager-2000019337/?artId=41450)

## Printer settings:
Most parts printed with 30-40% infill, 0.3mm layer height.
Rolls and chuck will be printed with higher innfill and thicker walls.

## Drillpress
Plans are made to fit a cheap drillpress from Jula, available in the Scandinavian countries. It's probably a cheap generic China made machine, and likely available around the world markedet with different names. If you can't fint it, just modify the plans to fit your machine.

A quick Google images search for 350W drillpress shows many very similar machines.

## Costs
The project goal was to keep it below 1000 NOK total, it can probably be done by using less bearings.

Current cost with drillpress is approximately 1300 NOK (150 USD)

Bearings 360 NOK (~45 USD)
Threaded rot + nuts are 100 NOK (~12  USD)
Drillpress 800 NOK (~100 USD)
3D Printer filament (have no idea how much, probably 200 meters total).


## Next revision
If this thing works, the following things needs to be fixed before I would recommend other to build it.

   Remove 45 degree nut mounts, instead have plain surface and use locknuts. Getting these things fitted in rev1 was a nightmare.
   Try to use less bearings.
   Determine if PLA printed rollers are strong enough, if not print in stronger material.
